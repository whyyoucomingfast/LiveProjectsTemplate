Introduction
Currently to communicate with the elderly or people with impaired hearing, the main way of communication is using a whiteboard and pen. This is a good solution but comes with many problems. For example, the white board doesn’t stay white and gets dirty fairly easily. It comes with minimal space making it hard to have a conversation. Also, many people don’t know how to use the whiteboard – they don’t plan what they are going to write and end usually running out of space. However, it does have one good use, which is to play tic-tac-toe therefore our app should be able to do this too.
The solution to this is to integrate technology, by creating an app to communicate with the elderly/hearing impaired. The core premise of the app is to use a speech-to-text function, allowing users to speak into the app and have the words appear on the screen. This would get rid of the whiteboard issues of running out of space. The app is designed be very simple to use, due to the fact the majority of users are going to be elderly and also the app is very accessible for users. High contrasted colours are used for better visuality and large fonts for easier reading.
It is a multi-platform app which makes use of a variety of technologies including Javascript, AngularJS, Ionic1 and Cordova, and is available on iOS and Android SDK’s.
